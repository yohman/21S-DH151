# Midterms and Finals

The midterm and final will both be group projects. They are based on the same project proposal that you will submit for your first Group Assignment due at the start of Week 3. Think of the midterm as a midpoint status report of what will eventually become your final project. In rare cases, you may decide to change your topic from your midterm to your final, but understand that doing so will require a monumental effort on the groups' part to reframe your research, find new datasets, and reproduce relevant material. It is highly recommended that you carefully examine the validity and "doability" of your project before embarking into it. 

A note of advice: your project is only as good as your data can take you. Heed the expression, "garbage in, garbage out."

## Midterms (20% of your final grade)
There are three deliverables for the mid-term project.
1. An updated proposal
1. An updated storyboard
1. A fully functional interactive website with the following sections:
      1. An `About` page with (at minimum) the following sections:
            - Group members: photos, titles, roles, and a short blurb
            - About the project: a strong description about what the project is about, its goal, and who it is for
            - Instructions: a "how to use the map" section
      1. A `maproom` page with (at minimum) the following features:
            - an interactive map
            - data driven: either through a csv file, Google Sheet
            - at least two categorically different layers
            - at least 10 objects per layer, each with a clear purpose and narrative
1. A presentation of your project to the class
   

## Final Project (30% of your final grade)
### Overview
The final project is a cumulative and applied group assignment that requires you to collectively use the skills you developed over the entire quarter. You have developed an inquisitive research question, and proposed the development of an interactive web map to expose, reveal, and help answer it using the data analysis, mapping,  statistics, and visualization methods you have learned in this course.

### Instructions

This is an extension of your mid-term project. On top of the deliverables for your midterm, your final project must also include:

1. A interactive dashboard of data the reveals metrics for objects that are highlighted on the map.
1. An equivalent user interface interaction that is pre-approved by your instructor
