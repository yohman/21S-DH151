# Overview

As a digital humanist, you are at the crossroads of three simple inquiries:  Where did it happen?  When did it happen?  Why did it happen? Space and time are forever interlinked, and the digital revolution has made it such that the visualization of the “spatial” and the “temporal” brings possibilities to interrogate, analyze, reveal, narrate and discover new dimensions that may otherwise remain dormant in its original state. In today’s Internet centered, social media frenzied society, spatial data is becoming one with the web. Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, Google Maps, Leaflet are examples of geospatial technologies centered around the notion that “location,”  “mobility,” and “time” are correlated, and they matter. Humanists are asking new questions, demanding justice from data that did not exist a decade ago, resulting in the creation of compelling web-based mapping applications that are empowering the public to become online cartographers.

The purpose of this course is to implement and examine such web-based technologies. Students will develop the knowledge and skills necessary to plan, design, develop and publish web-based digital mapping solutions. Students will learn how GIS on the internet differs from the desktop experience, and how to prepare spatial information for the web. Although no prior programming experience is required, the course is specifically designed to bring out the “coder” in the “non-coder,” and will teach the basics of internet programming languages. Different web technologies will be explored, including WordPress as a content management platform, Google Maps API, Leaflet Javascript API, and MySQL databases.

It should be noted that the course is primarily a programming class. On top of the web-GIS discussion, we will cover the technical details about web servers and networks that are necessary for a solid and comprehensive understanding of web technologies and web programming in general. Students will be expected to fully code and produce a functioning interactive, database driven mapping website.

# Class format
The class will be conducted as a studio course, and students will form groups to deliver full-fledged GIS websites according to their research interests. Pedagogic strategies to use a studio based approach is to provide students with a project based environment that strongly resembles the multiple phases required in any web development project team. The studio aims to encourage students to work in collaborative and cooperative activities, and to present ideas as collective group presentations.

The class will meet once a week, and will consist of a combination of short lectures, hands on training on different web technologies, and a segment dedicated for studio project group activities. In addition, I hope to invite current practitioners in the field of web-based GIS as guest speakers and lecturers. Students will be assigned weekly readings and assignments geared to train them on the technical skills necessary. These assignments must be completed prior to coming to each class, and students will be asked to demonstrate their grasp of these technologies via class participation and discussions.

# Studio Group Projects

Students will be tasked to create a web-based mapping site for researching neighborhoods that may include queryable statistical layers on demographics, housing, transportation or other planning related datasets. In addition, projects must incorporate “streaming” data sources from online data providers such as Twitter, Metro LA, US Census, or other open data portal datasets.

Within the first 5 weeks of the course, students will be asked to submit, as well as present to the class, a proposal, scope and development plan for their portion of the website. Initial tasks will include:

a web design strategy to understand web based user experiences and designing effective user interfaces
research available data for your topic and put together a data plan
come up with a full web-site proposal (including wire-frames, screenshot sketches and diagrams, timelines and budget)
research of available web technologies and come up with a technology assessment
compiling query-able spatial data layers, designing an intuitive user flow and interface for their data, and developing an interactive maproom using Leaflet and MySQL (or comparable technologies).
A weekly “Thinking captain’s” blog entry that reflects on the student’s understanding on the technologies covered and how it relates to their project
Week 6 will be reserved for project presentations, and weeks 7-10 will be dedicated towards development time, and will focus heavily on studio work.

The final product will result in an intuitive, searchable, map-based website, and will be used by future humanities students as well as the general public.
