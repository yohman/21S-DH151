    "> Pair programming can be an extremely beneficial process, which results in improved code and increased team collaboration. Pair programming is the act of two developers programming together. In this process, one person drives by physically typing code into the computer, while the second person navigates by talking through the code that is being written with the driver. When done well, pair programming is extremely effective."

Perhaps the biggest and most common failure in pair programming that I have seen is when experienced developers are dismissive of ideas made by junior developers. Successful pair programming happens when both parties view it as an opportunity to learn and grow."
