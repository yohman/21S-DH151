# Group Assignment #4 Additional interactivity

Your fourth (and final!) group assignment is to propose the incorporation of additional interactivity. This may be in the form of data charts, tables, sliders, etc. You are welcome to use the materials from the Week 9 lab and adapt it to your project, or experiment with other libraries to create interactivity that informs your specific project needs.

Recommended libraries:

## Charts

- https://apexcharts.com/
- https://www.chartjs.org/
- https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/index.html
- https://developers.google.com/chart (not open source but free)
- 
## Tables

- https://gridjs.io/docs/examples/import-json
- http://js-grid.com/getting-started/

## Sliders
- http://ionden.com/a/plugins/ion.rangeSlider/

## Timelines and network graphs
- https://visjs.org/

Submit a fully functional maproom that incorporates the following:
- User action (hover/click) that triggers the creation of a chart, OR
- User action on an interactive element outside of the map (like a table or slider) that changes the map in some way
