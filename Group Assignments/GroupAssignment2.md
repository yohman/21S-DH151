# Group Assignment #2 

## Part 1: Data plan update

It is time to narrow down on your datasets. Submit a data plan that includes the following:

- List all datasets (with links) that you intend to use in your project
- Include a short description no how the data will be used (ex. "Data will be downloaded as a csv file from _link_ and geocoded using Python. Each category of data by _fieldname_ will be a separate layer on the map assigned with a different color icon, and toggles will allow users to turn them on/off. Narratives will be driven by combining _fieldnames_ and be available as a popup box as users hover over individual icons.")
