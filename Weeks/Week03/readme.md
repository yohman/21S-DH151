# Assignments

## Thinking Cap

What is UX design?

Additionally, submit one or two questions for our guest speaker next week, [Alesha Unpingco](https://ace.alumni.ucla.edu/alesha-unpingco/).

- Submit your assignment [here](https://github.com/yohman/21S-DH151/discussions/26)

## Individual Coding Assignment

Complete the in-class lab, and submit your finalized Story Map. Your Story Map should include (but not limited to) the following elements:

- A fully functional interactive map
- "Data" driven narrative, using a javascript object with key:value pairs that generate the markers, narratives, links, and images as necessary on the map
- A data-driven sidebar with clickable elements that help navigate the map-based narrative
- At least one additional feature that is not covered in the lab that makes your map "different." This could be a unique design/layout of the site, or it could be a functionality component that adds to the user experience. Be creative!
- Submit your assignment [here](https://github.com/yohman/21S-DH151/discussions/27)

## Reading assignment:

Note: Reading assigments are mandatory. While there will be no quizzes or submission requirements, future labs are designed under the assumption that you have read and understood the materials in the readings.

- Read [Chapter 2 CSS](https://geobgu.xyz/web-mapping2/css.html).
