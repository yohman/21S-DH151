## Assignments

### Individual assignment: Provide feedback to two midterm projects

Go to the discussion section and navigate to the [midterm assignments](https://github.com/yohman/21S-DH151/discussions/47). Provide feedback to **two other midterm projects**, making sure to include the following:

- What you liked about the project. Be specific!
- What you recommend the project can work on/improve on for the final (features, additional layers, design/interactive components, improved layout, narrative flow, etc)

Do not provide feedback to a project that already has more than six comments!

### Thinking cap

Topic: Thick mapping in the digital humanities

[Read pages 6-21](https://github.com/yohman/21S-DH151/raw/main/Readings/HyperCities_2014_FINAL.pdf)

Submit a "thinking cap" reaction to the reading. Specifically, discuss the following:

- What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"
- How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?
