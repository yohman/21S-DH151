## Assignments

### Individual Assignment: Thinking Cap on "Design Justice"

What do you think about design justice? How might you apply it in your designs going forward?

- The reading on [Design Justice](https://github.com/albertkun/21S-ASIAAM-191A/blob/main/Week_6/Materials/Design_Justice.pdf) will be important to completing this thinking cap.

Submit your thinking cap [here](https://github.com/yohman/21S-DH151/discussions/65).

### Group Assignment

There are no graded group deliverables for next week. However, in two weeks (Week 10), you will be asked to submit a pre-final prototype/status report (fourth and final group assignment). As your group gears towards the final deadline, I ask that each group answer a [short set of questions](https://github.com/yohman/21S-DH151/discussions/66).
