# Midterms and Finals

The midterm and final will both be group projects. They are based on the same project proposal that you will submit for your first Group Assignment due at the start of Week 3. Think of the midterm as a midpoint status report of what will eventually become your final project. In rare cases, you may decide to change your topic from your midterm to your final, but understand that doing so will require a monumental effort on the groups' part to reframe your research, find new datasets, and reproduce relevant material. It is highly recommended that you carefully examine the validity and "doability" of your project before embarking into it. 

A note of advice: your project is only as good as your data can take you. Heed the expression, "garbage in, garbage out."

## Midterms (20% of your final grade)

Another way to think about your midterm is that this is the "prototype" phase of your project.

There are three deliverables for the mid-term project.
1. An updated proposal that includes elements from the [Group Assignment #1](https://github.com/yohman/21S-DH151/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/GroupAssignment1.md) including your new data plan and all UX components.
1. A fully functional interactive website with the following sections:
      1. An `About` page with (at minimum) the following sections:
            - Group members: photos, titles, roles, and a short blurb
            - About the project: a strong description about what the project is about, its goal, and who it is for
            - Instructions: a "how to use the map" section
      1. A `maproom` page with (at minimum) the following features:
            - an interactive map
            - data driven: either through a csv file, Google Sheet, or API endpoint
            - at least two categorically different layers
            - at least 10 objects per layer, each with a clear purpose and narrative
1. An 8 minute lightning "live" presentation of your project to the class. Suggested flow:
      1. Introduce your group, its members, and your research (no more than 30 seconds)
      2. Let the audience know why this web map is important (what is at stake and why should we care) (1.5 minutes)
      3. Introduce concept art, mindmaps, storyboards, and other UX design elements (2 minutes)
      4. Demonstrate the site and its functionalities! (3 minutes)
      5. Provide next steps (1 minute)

## Final Project (30% of your final grade)
### Overview
The final project is a cumulative and applied group assignment that requires you to collectively use the skills you developed over the entire quarter. You have developed an inquisitive research question, and proposed the development of an interactive web map to expose, reveal, and help answer it using the data analysis, mapping,  statistics, and visualization methods you have learned in this course.

### Instructions

Final instructions (much of this will be based on the direction the group projects lean towards in the final weeks of the course).

This is an extension of your mid-term project. On top of the deliverables for your midterm, your final project must also include:

1. A choropleth layer
1. An interactive component like a time slider
1. A interactive dashboard of data the reveals metrics for objects that are highlighted on the map.
1. An equivalent user interface interaction that is pre-approved by your instructor

Your final project will be graded on the following rubric:

1. User interface, user experience, design: How well does your website flow? Is the layout and design elements intuitive? Is it easy to use? How well does it consider the user's experience?
3. Interactive map: This is, after all, a web-GIS course. The interactive map should be the central driving force of your project. How well does your maproom inform and communicate the intended purpose of the site? Do the data points make sense? Are the choropleth maps informative? Do you have a legend?
4. Interactive components: Beyond the map, we have learned a variety of ways to enhance user interaction with data visualizations. Do the interactive components like charts, tables, buttons, sliders, function in a way that illuminates additional narratives?
5. Originality: How well have you grasped the course material? Have you created your own functions that work specifically for your project? Does the project have a unique identity beyond what was offered in the labs?
6. Usefulness: Ultimately
